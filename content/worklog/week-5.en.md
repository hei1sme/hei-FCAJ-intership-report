### Week 5 Achievements

* **Architecture:**
  * Completed comprehensive AWS architecture diagram with data flow.
  * Selected services based on serverless-first, cost-effective approach.
  * Architecture reviewed and approved by team.

* **AWS Environment:**
  * IAM roles configured with Principle of Least Privilege.
  * S3 buckets created: `nutritrack-media-dev`, `nutritrack-data-dev`.
  * DynamoDB table designed with single-table pattern for efficient queries.

* **Documentation:**
  * Proposal draft 70% complete with clear objectives and timeline.
  * Estimated 3-month development timeline aligned with internship period.

### Challenges & Lessons

* **Challenges:**
  * DynamoDB single-table design is different from traditional relational thinking.
  * Balancing cost optimization with performance requirements.

* **Solutions:**
  * Used Alex DeBrie's DynamoDB book and examples as reference.
  * Created access pattern document first, then designed schema.

* **Lessons Learned:**
  * Access patterns must be defined before DynamoDB schema design.
  * On-demand pricing is better for development; provisioned for production.

### Next Week Plan

* Complete and submit NutriTrack Proposal for review.
* Start backend implementation: API endpoints structure.
* Set up Lambda development environment with SAM CLI.
* Define OpenAPI specification for NutriTrack APIs.

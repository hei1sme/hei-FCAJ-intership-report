### Week 1 Achievements:

* 100% of team members (5/5) have fully joined all work channels:
  * Discord Server "NeuraX HQ"
  * GitHub Organization
  * Trello Board

* Published 02 important documents:
  * Kick-off Meeting Minutes
  * Team Operating Regulations

* Gained basic knowledge of AWS:
  * Understood overview of AWS service groups (Compute, Storage, Networking, Database)
  * Learned about IAM: Users, Groups, Policies and permission management
  * Researched S3: Bucket, Objects, Storage Classes
  * Familiarized with EC2: Instance types, AMI, Security Groups

* Completed Personal Report Website setup and deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Brainstormed ideas with the team but no specific idea finalized yet, need to continue discussion next week.

### Challenges & Lessons:

* **Challenges:** 
  * Configuring Branch Protection Rules on GitHub initially failed due to insufficient Admin permissions for the Bot account.
  * AWS services are numerous and complex, requiring time to fully understand.

* **Solutions:** 
  * Referenced GitHub Docs and granted Owner/Admin permissions to the Bot account.
  * Focused on learning one service at a time, starting with the most basic ones (IAM, S3, EC2).

* **Lessons Learned:** 
  * Need to carefully check Organization permissions before configuration.
  * Should have a clear AWS learning roadmap, avoid learning too many services at once.

### Next Week Plan:

* Continue learning more basic AWS services (VPC, Lambda, API Gateway).
* Go to the company to get familiar with the actual working environment and meet the team.
* Main goal: Finalize the official project idea in Week 2.
* Start drafting the Proposal if the idea is confirmed.

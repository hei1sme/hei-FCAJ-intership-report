### Week 2 Achievements

* Hands-on Skills:
  * Learned to initialize and manage 5 core services: **EC2** (Compute), **RDS** (Database), **Lambda** (Serverless), **Bedrock** (AI), **Budgets** (Cost).
  * Successfully set up budget alarm (Budget Alarm) to avoid unexpected charges.

* Knowledge:
  * Completed 100% of Coursera Week 1.
  * Understood the **Shared Responsibility Model** and basic **VPC** network architecture.

* Extracurricular Activities:
  * Received uniform shirt, officially integrated into FCJ culture.

### Challenges & Lessons

* **Challenges:**
  * VPC concepts (Subnet, CIDR block) are quite abstract and difficult to visualize packet flow.
  * RDS Lab took longer than expected provisioning time.

* **Solutions:**
  * Redrew network diagrams on paper for better understanding.
  * Read theory documentation while waiting for RDS to provision.

* **Lessons Learned:**
  * Networking is core: Without understanding VPC, connecting services is impossible (e.g., Lambda cannot call RDS). Need to spend more time on this.

### Next Week Plan

* Focus: Finalize Idea Proposal "NeuraX Knowledge Vault" (Secure-RAG).
* Technical: Deep dive into **Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base** (for RAG project).
* Administrative: Register office schedule for next Tuesday.

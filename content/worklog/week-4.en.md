### Week 4 Achievements

* **Project Milestone:**
  * ✅ **NutriTrack 2.0 officially approved** as the team's capstone project.
  * Defined project scope: AI-powered nutrition tracking with meal recommendations.
  * Team roles assigned: Backend (2), Frontend (1), AI/ML (1), DevOps (1).

* **AWS re:Invent 2025 Recap Event Learnings:**
  * **Amazon Bedrock & Nova Models:** Learned about Nova Text-to-Speech, Nova Canvas, and fine-tuning capabilities for local context (e.g., Vietnamese laws).
  * **Bedrock Agents (Agentic AI):** Understood Orchestration/Flow, Memory, Policy/Guardrails, and Evaluation components.
  * **SageMaker Unified Studio:** Discovered the unified IDE for Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and AI Engineers with one-click onboarding.
  * **Amazon S3 Updates:** Learned about S3 Tables (Iceberg support) and S3 Vector for native vector storage with significant cost reduction.
  * **OpenSearch Agentic Search:** MCP integration, Agent Memory, and specialized agents for analytics.
  * **Advanced RAG:** Nova Multimodal Embeddings for video/image search.

* **Technical Knowledge:**
  * Mastered Amazon Cognito authentication patterns.
  * Understood S3 advanced features relevant to NutriTrack (image upload, lifecycle).

### Challenges & Lessons

* **Challenges:**
  * Information overload from AWS re:Invent event (5 sessions in one day).
  * Mapping new services to NutriTrack requirements required careful evaluation.

* **Solutions:**
  * Created structured notes during each session with "Relevance to NutriTrack" column.
  * Team review meeting the next day to filter actionable insights.

* **Lessons Learned:**
  * AWS continuously innovates; staying updated is essential for architecture decisions.
  * Bedrock Agents could be a future enhancement for NutriTrack (conversational meal planning).
  * S3 Vector might reduce costs compared to OpenSearch for simple vector use cases.

### Next Week Plan

* Complete detailed architecture diagram with all AWS services.
* Set up AWS development environment (IAM roles, S3 buckets).
* Begin Proposal documentation for submission.
* Research Amazon API Gateway and Lambda best practices.

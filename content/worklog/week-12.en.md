### Final Reflection

This 12-week internship at AWS Vietnam through the FCJ program has been a transformative experience. From setting up team infrastructure in Week 1 to delivering a production-ready AI-powered application in Week 12, the journey has taught me the importance of:

1. **Serverless-first thinking** for cost-effective, scalable applications
2. **Documentation as code** for maintainability and knowledge transfer
3. **Early and continuous testing** to prevent last-minute surprises
4. **Team collaboration** as the key to successful project delivery

I am grateful to the FCJ mentors, AWS Solution Architects, and my Team NeuraX colleagues for making this experience unforgettable. This is not the end, but the beginning of my cloud journey! ☁️🚀

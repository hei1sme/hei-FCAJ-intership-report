### Week 3 Achievements

* AI/ML Knowledge:
  * Gained comprehensive understanding of **Amazon Bedrock** ecosystem.
  * Learned how **Knowledge Bases** implement RAG: data chunking → vector embeddings → semantic search → augmented generation.
  * Compared Foundation Models: Claude 3 (best reasoning), Titan (AWS native), Llama 3 (open-source).

* Project Progress:
  * Team narrowed down from 3 proposals to 1 merged concept: **NutriTrack 2.0** (combining NutriTrack + SnapChef).
  * Initial architecture draft completed focusing on serverless design.

* Serverless Skills:
  * Understood API Gateway routing and Lambda trigger patterns.
  * Learned DynamoDB single-table design concepts.

### Challenges & Lessons

* **Challenges:**
  * RAG concepts are complex; vector embeddings and similarity search require mathematical understanding.
  * Team had different visions for the project; required multiple discussions to align.

* **Solutions:**
  * Watched YouTube tutorials on embeddings and vector databases.
  * Created a shared Miro board to visualize everyone's ideas before voting.

* **Lessons Learned:**
  * RAG is powerful but requires proper data preparation (chunking strategy matters).
  * Early team alignment saves time later; conflicts resolved early prevent bigger issues.

### Next Week Plan

* Finalize and vote on the official project proposal (NutriTrack 2.0).
* Begin detailed architecture design for NutriTrack.
* Attend AWS re:Invent 2025 Recap Event at AWS Vietnam Office.
* Learn about Amazon S3 advanced features and Amazon Cognito for authentication.
